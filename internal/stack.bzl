"""PostCSS stack rule.

Using postcss_stack allows reuse of PostCSS plugin configuration. (Without
resorting to methods such as top-level constants.)

When postcss_stack is used in conjunction with workers for postcss_binary,
the worker process will be able to cache instantiated PostCSS plugins.

    Args:
        name: The name of the build rule.
        plugins: A map of postcss_plugin targets to JavaScript config object
            strings.

            Plugin configurations are interpreted as JavaScript code, and can
            refer to the following pre-defined variables:

            * `bazel.binDir`: The root of Bazel's generated binary tree.

            * `bazel.additionalOutputs`: An array of all the file paths passed
              to the `additional_outputs` attribute of `postcss_binary`, to
              which a plugin is expected to write.

            * `bazel.data`: An array of all the file paths for targets passed to
              the `data` or `named_data` attribute of `postcss_binary`.

              `bazel.data.${name}` can also be used to access the file paths for
              individual targets passed to `named_data`. For example, if you
              pass `named_data = {"license": "license.txt"}`, you can access
              the path of the license file via `bazel.data.license[0]`.

              It's strongly recommended to use `named_data` over `data` when you
              want to access a specific target's file(s), and only use the array
              value to access *all* data files no matter which target they come
              from.

        deps: Additional NodeJS modules the config depends on. The PostCSS
            module and plugin modules are always implicitly included.
        **kwargs: Standard BUILD arguments to pass.
