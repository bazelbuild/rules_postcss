    It is strongly recommended to use postcss_plugin to define PostCSS plugins
    as available targets, in lieu of nodejs_module.

    For forward compatibility purposes, although postcss_plugin is currently
    equivalent to defining a filegroup with arbitrary grouping, PostCSS plugins
    should be defined using postcss_plugin. This file can be substituted in
    internal copies of these build rules, which can make use of the extra
    grouping information.

    In the future, postcss_plugin targets are intended to provide extra
    information to postcss_binary rules. As such, using unsupported build rules
    to represent PostCSS plugins may lead to breakages in the future.

        name: The name of the build rule.
